# 🏠 House Price Prediction - ML Task 1

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict **house prices** based on key features like:  
- **Square footage (`GrLivArea`)**
- **Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)**
- **Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)**

The model is trained using **Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)**.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset comes from Kaggle’s **Ames Housing dataset** and includes various property attributes.  
- **Train dataset:** `train.csv` (used for model training)  
- **Test dataset:** `test.csv` (used for evaluation)  

### **Features Used for Prediction**
| Feature        | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `GrLivArea`   | Above-ground living area (sq. ft) |
| `BedroomAbvGr` | Number of bedrooms above ground |
| `FullBath`    | Number of full bathrooms |

**Target Variable:**  
- `SalePrice` → The final price of the house.

 ## **🏆 Conclusion**<br>
This project trains a Linear Regression model for house price prediction.
The model evaluates well using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score.
Predictions can be improved by adding more features & advanced models.<br>
